### I The Common Virtues

I might say that virtue potentially contains intellectuality, for, since it leads to our end, which is intellectual, virtue is equivalent to the supreme knowledge.

One could draw many things from that, everything indeed; for this primacy of the moral order involves the relative dependence of truth, of beauty, of harmony, of unity, of being itself with regard to morality, which is thus related to the first principle of all things.

But I prefer to follow a humbler path.

The qualities of character have a preponderant role in everything. The intellect is only a tool; the handling of it determines the nature of its effects. Properly to regulate the intelligence, is it not evident that qualities quite different from intelligence itself are required?Instinctively, every right mind declares that superiority in any branch includes a measure of spiritual superiority. To judge truly, you must be great.

Would there not be something repellent in seeing a great discovery made by an unprincipled rascal? The unspoiled instinct of a simple man
would be grievously hurt by it. There is something shocking in a dissociation which dislocates the harmony of the human being. One has no faith in jewel merchants who sell pearls and wear none. To be in close contact with the great spring of all things without acquiring anything of its moral nature seems a paradox. To enjoy the faculty of
intelligence, and to make of it an isolated force, a "bump," is, one suspects, a dangerous game; for every isolated force in a balanced whole becomes the victim of its surroundings.

If then character makes shipwreck, one must ex-
pect the sense of the great truths to sufer. The
mind, being no longer held in check, no longer
finding its level, will start down some dangerous in-
cline, and one knows that a small error in the be
ginning becomes great in the end. The force of
logic may .send to a more precipitous fall the man
whose faculty of discernment finds no safeguard in
his soul. That is the cause of so many sensational
lapses, and of so many blunders with a spark of
genius in them, among masters who have lost the

true direction of life.

Life is a unity: it would be very surprising if We
could give fullest play to one of its functions while
18
VIRTUES OF AN INTELLECTUAL

neglecting the other, or if to live our ideas should
not help us to perceive them.

What is the source of this unity of life? Love.
"Tell me what you love, I will tell you what you
are." Love is the beginning of everything in us; and
that starting point which is common to knowledge
and practice cannot fail to make the right paths of
both in a certain measure interdependent.

Truth visits those who love her, who surrender
to her, and this love cannot be without virtue. For
this reason, in spite of his possible defects, the man
of genius at work is already virtuous; it would
suffice for his holiness if he were more completely
his true self.

The true springs up in the same soil as the
good: their roots communicate. Broken from the
common root and therefore less in contact with the
soil, one or other suffers; the soul grows anemic or
the mind wilts. On the contrary, by feeding the
mind on truth one enlightens the conscience, by
fostering good one guides knowledge.

By practising the truth that we know, we merit
the truth that we do not yet know. We merit it in
the sight of God; we merit it also with a merit
which brings its own reward; for all truths are
linked together, and homage in act being the most
decisive of all, when we pay that homage by living
the truth of life, we draw near to the supreme light
and to all that flows from it.1 If I embark on the
tributary, I reach the river, and then the sea.

Let us look a little more closely into this doctrine
which is so important,-so important that simply to
recall it would have made the writing of this litle
work worthwhile.

VIRTUES OF AN INTELLECTUAL

How will you manage to think rightly with a sick
soul, a heart ravaged by vice, pulled this way and
that by passion, dragged astray by violent or guilty
love? There is, Gratry said, a clear-sighted and a
blind state of the soul; a sound and therefore sensi-
ble state, and a state of folly. "The exercise of the
moral virtues," St. Thomas of Aquin tells you in
his turn, "of the virtues by which the passions are
held in check, is of great importance for the ac-

quisition of knowledge."

Yes indeed! Think it out. On what, first and fore-
most, does all the effort of study depend? On atten-
tion, which delimits the field for research, concen-
trates on it, brings all our powers to bear on it;
next, on judgment, which gathers up the fruit of
investigation. Now, passions and vices relax atten-
tion, scatter it, lead it astray; and they injure the
judgment in roundabout ways, of which Aristotle
and many others after him have scrutinized the

meanders.

All contemporary psychologists are in agreement
here; the fact is plain to see, admitting of no doubt.
The "psychology of the feelings" governs practice,
but also, to a large extent, thought. Knowledge de-
pends on the direction given to our passions and
on our moral habits. To calm our passions is to
awaken in ourselves the sense of the universal; to cor-
rect ourselves is to bring out the sense of the true.

which makes the body weak and lethargie, befogs
the imagination, dulls the intelligence, scatters the
memory? Of pride, which sometimes dazzles and
sometimes darkens, which so drives us in the direc-
tion of our own opinion that the universal sense
may escape us? Of envy, which obstinately refuses
to acknowledge some light other than our own? Of
irritation which repels criticism and comes to grief
on the rock of error?

But, stupidity

Without these obstacles, a man of study will rise
to heights greater or less according to his resources
and his environment; but he will reach the level of

his own gifts, of his own destiny.

We must notice that all the faults just mentioned
bring one another more or less in their train; they
intersect, they ramify, they are with regard to love
of the good or contempt for the good what inter-
secting streamlets are to the spring. Purity of
thought requires purity of soul; that is a general
and undeniable truth. The neophyte of knowledge

should let it sink deeply into his mind.

Let us rise higher, and speaking of springs, let us
not forget the Supreme Spring. The surest meta-
physic tells us that at the summit of things, the
true and the good are not only connected, but are

identical.

We must state for exactness' sake, that the good

22
VIRTUES OF AN IN TELLECTUAL

thus spoken of is not properly speaking moral good;
desirable good is what is directly referred to; but a
little circuit brings us back from the latter to the
former.

Moral good is nothing else than desirable good
measured by reason and set before the will as an
end. Ends are related. They all depend on one
ultimate end. It is this ultimate end which links
up with the true and is one with it. Connect these
propositions, and you will find that moral good, if
not identical in every way with the true, still de-
pends on it through the ends aimed at by the will.
There is, therefore, between the two, a bond more
or less loose or close, but unbreakable.

It is not by the individuality in us that we ap-
proach truth; it is in virtue of a participation in
the universal. This universal, which is at one and
the same time the true and the good, cannot be
honored as the true--we cannot enter into intimate
union with it, discover its traces, and yield our-
selves to its mighty sway-unless we recognize and
serve it equally as the good.

Climb up the Great Pyramid by those giant steps
that so exactly represent the ascent of the true: if
you go up by the northern edge, can you reach the
summit without getting nearer and nearer to the
southern edge? To keep away from it would be to
stay on the low levels; to turn away from it would
be to go sideways and downwards. Similarly the
genius of the true tends of itself to join the good;
if it diverges it is at the expense of its upward im-
pulse towards the summits.

Blessed are the pure of heart, said the Lord, they

sponsiveness of the soul to the ineffable spring, its
flial and loving dispositions, lay it open to receive
light after light, and ever-increasing fervor and
rectitude. Trúth, when loved and realized as a life,
shows itself to be a first principle; one's vision is
according to what one is; one participates in truth
by participating in the Spirit through whom it
exists. Great personal intuitions, piercing lights, are
in men of equal powers the consequence of moral
progress, of detachment from self and from the

commonplace things, of humility, simplicity,

There is no question now of proving one's skill,
of showing off the brilliance of one's powers, as of a
jewel; one desires to get into communion with the
radiant center of light and life; one approaches
this center in its unity, as it is; one adores it, and
renounces what is opposed to it in order to be
flooded with its glory. Is not all that something like
the meaning of the famous words: "Great thoughts
come from the heart"? 1

for knowledge, and that the more moral rectitude

VIRTUES OF AN INTELLECTUAL

we bring to study, the more fruitful the study is.
Yet there is a virtue proper to the intellectual, and
we must dwell on it here, although it will recur
often in the course of these pages.

The virtue proper to the man of study is, clearly,
studiousness. Do not jump to the conclusion that
this is a naïve statement: our masters in doctrine
have included many things in that virtue, and have

distinguished from it many other things.

St. Thomas placed studiousness under the head-
ing of the controlling virtue of temperance, to in-
dicate that of itself, knowledge is no doubt always
to be welcomed, but that our life is so. ordered as
to require us to temper, that is, to adapt to circum-
stances and to reconcile with other duties, a thịst

for knowing that may easily run to excess.

When I say to excess, I mean in both directions.
To the virtue of studiousness, two vices are op-
posed: negligence on the one hand, vain curiosity
on the other. We shall not speak here of the former;
if it is not hateful to the reader when he comes to
close this little book, it will be because he has
grown weary on the way, or because we have
managed the journey very badly. It is not the same
with curiosity. This fault can creep in under cover
of our best instincts, and vitiate them at the very

moment that it pretends to satisfy them.

We have already referred to the ambitious ideas
which pervert an intellectual vocation. Without
going as far as that, ambition may injure studious-
ness, and hinder the usefulness of its results. An act

1St. Thomas, Summa Theologica, 2a, 2ae, qu. 167.

25
THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE

of ambition apropos of knowledge ceases to be an
act of the pursuit of knowledge, and he who in-
dulges in it ceases .to deserve the name of an intel-
lectual.

Every other faulty purpose would call for the

same verdict.

On the other hand, study, even when it is dis.
interested and right in itself, is not always oppor-
tune; if it is not, the person who then pursues
knowledge forgets his duty as a man, and what is

to be said of the intellectual who is not a man?

Other duties than study are human duties.
Knowledge taken in an absolute sense is no doubt
our supreme good, but the modicum of it that is
granted to us here is often subordinated to other
values which, in regard of merit, will be its equiva-

lent.

A country priest who devotes himself to his
parishioners, a doctor who turns away from study to
give help in urgent cases, a young man of good
family who adopts a calling to help his people and
in doing so has to turn his back on liberal studies,
are not profaning the gift that is in them, they are
paying homage to the True which is one and the
same Being with the Good. If they acted otherwise
they would offend truth no less than virtue, since,
indirectly, they would be setting living truth at

variance with itsel.

One sees many men avid for knowledge who do
not hesitate to sacrifice to it their strictest duties.
They are not men of study, they are dilettanti.
26
VIRTUES OF AN INTELLECTUAL
Or else they abandon the study demanded by their
obligations and take up some other that latters
their inclination, and their loss of quality is the

same.

Those who aim at what is beyond their powers,

and thus run the risk of falling into error, who
waste their real capacity in order to acquire some
capacity that is illusory, are also men of curiosity
in the olden sense. Two of St. Thomas's sixteen
precepts for study concern them: "Altiora te ne
quaesieris, do not seek what is beyond your reach."
"Volo ut per rivulos, non statim, in mare eligas
introire; I want you to decide to go to the sea by
the streams, not directly." Precious advice, which
serves knowledge as well as virtue by giving balance

to the man.

Do not overload the foundation, do not carry the
building higher than the base permits, or build at
all before the base is secure: otherwise the whole

structure is likely to collapse.

What are you? What point have you reached?

What intellectual substructure have you to offer?
These are the things that must wisely determine
your undertaking. "If you want to see things grow
big, plant small," say the foresters; and that is, in
other words, St. Thomas's advice. The wise man
begins at the beginning, and does not take a second
step until he has made sure of the first. That is
why self-taught men have so many weak points.
They cannot, all by themselves, begin at the begin-
ning. When they join a group already well on the
27
THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE

road, they find themselves at a stage where other
stages have already been passed, and there is no one
to show them the approaches.

On the other hand, what is true of each one as
to the stages of his development is true of each one
in relation to others. We must not overestimate our-
selves, but we must judge of our capacity. To ac-
cept ourselves as we are is to obey God and to make
sure of good results. Does nature seek to exceed
her powers? Everything in nature is exactly meas-
ured, without vain effort and without false esti-
mates. Every creature acts according to its quantity
and quality, its nature and its power, and then is
at peace. Man alone lives in pretentiousness and

dissatisfaction.

What wisdom and what virtue there is in judging
oneself truly and in remaining oneself! You have a
part that only you can play; and your business is to
play it to perfection, instead of trying to force
fortune. Our lives are not interchangeable. Equally
by aiming too high and by falling too low, one
misses the path to the goal. Go straight ahead, in

your own way, with God for guide.

To this necessary prudence St. Thomas adds the
importance of not letting one's curiosity linger over
earthly objects at the expense of the supreme ob-
ject. Later on we shall draw from that a conse-
quence which is important for the organization of
our work; 1 but study must first of all leave room
for worship, prayer, direct meditation on the things
of God. Study is itself a divine office, an indirect

1 CÉ. below: The Field of Work: Comparative Study.

28
VIRTUES OF AN INTELLECTUAL
divine office; it seeks out and honors the traces of
the Creator, or His images, according as it investi-
gates nature or humanity; but it must make way at
the right moment for direct intercourse with Him.
If we forget to do this, not only do we neglect a
great duty, but the image of God in creation comes
between us and Him, and His traces only serve to
lead us far from Him to whom they bear witness.

Study carried to such a point that we give up
prayer and recollection, that we cease to read Holy
Scripture, and the words of the saints and of great
souls-study carried to the point of forgetting our-
selves entirely, and of concentrating on the objects
of study so that we neglect the Divine Dweller
within us, is an abuse and a fool's game. To sup-
pose that it will further our progress and enrich
our production is to say that the stream will ffow
better if its spring is dried up.

The order of the mind must correspond to the
order of things. In the world of reality, everything
rises towards the divine, everything depends on it,
because everything springs from it. In the effigy of
the real within us, we can note the same depend-
ence, unless we have turned topsy-turvy the true
relations of things.

III
These dispositions will be secured, if apart from
the exercises of piety which precede our study, we

cultivate in work itself the spirit of prayer.

It is again St. Thomas who tells the passionate

seeker after knowledge: "Orationi vacare non

29
THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE

desinas: never give up praying," and Van Helmont
explains this precept when he says these sublime

words: "Every study is a study of eternity."

We repeat continually that science (scientia) is
knowledge by causes. Details are nothing: facts are
nothing: the important things are the dependences,
the transmissions of infuence, the connecting links,
the exchanges, which constitute the life of nature.
Now, behind all these dependences, is the primal
dependence; at the spot to which all connections
converge is the supreme Bond; at the highest point
of all transmissions, the Spring; beneath the ex
changes the Gift; beneath the systole and diastole of
the world, the Heart, the boundless Heart of Be-
ing. Must not the mind refer back to it unceasingly,
and never for a minute lose touch with what is
thus the All of all things, and consequently of all

knowledge?

Intelligence only plays its part fully when it ful.
fils a religious function, that is, when it worships
the supreme Truth in its minor and scattered ap-

pearances.

Each truth is a fragment which does not stand
alone but reveals connections on every side. Truth

in itself is one, and the Truth is God.

Every truth is a reflection; behind the refection,
and giving it value, is the Light. Every being is a
witness; every fact is a divine secret; beyond them
is the object of the revelation, the hero witnessed
to. Everything true stands out against the Infinite
as against its background; is related to it; belongs
to it. A particular truth may indeed occupy the
30
VIRTUES OF AN INTELLECTUAL

stage, but there are boundless immensities beyond.
One might say a particular truth is only a symbol,
a symbol that is real, a sacrament of the absolute;
it is a sign, and it exists, but not of itself; it does
not stand of itself; it lives by what it borrows and

would die if left to its own unsubstantiality.

Hence, for the fully awakened soul, every truth
is a meeting-place; the sovereign Thought invites

ours to the sublime meeting; shall we miss it?

The life of the real is not entirely in what we
see, in what we can analyze by knowledge. The real
has a hidden life, like Jesus, and this life also is a
life in God; it is, as it were, a life of God; it is a
revelation of His wisdom in laws, of His power in
effects, of His goodness in the usefulness of things,
of His tendency to diffuse Himself in exchange
and growth; it is a kind of incarnation which we
must venerate and love, keeping in contact with
Him who thus embodies Himself. To separate this
"body of God" from His Spirit is to abuse it; just
as it is an abuse of Christ to see in Him the man

only.

The Incarnation of Christ leads up to Com-
munion, in which the Body, Blood, Soul, and
Divinity of the Saviour are not separated; the quasi-
incarnation of God in being, of eternal Truth in
every separate instance of the truth, should also lead
up to a heavenly ecstasy, instead of our absent-
minded investigations, and commonplace feelings

of admiration.

Let us make up our minds to work under the

1 See page ix of Preface, and pages 133, 255.

31
THE INTELLE CTUAL LIFE

protective wing of the great laws and under the
Supreme Law. Neither knowledge, nor any other
manifestation of life, should be separated from its
roots in the soul and in reality-where the God of
the heart and the God of heaven are revealed and
are one. Unity must be established among our
acts (including the act of learning) and our
thoughts, and our primal realities. In everything
let us have the whole soul, the whole of nature and
of duration, and Divinity itself with uş.

We must add that to attain this spirit of prayer

in study, it is not necessary to give oneself up to
any mysterious incantation. No extrinsic effort is
required. It is true that to call on God and to in-
voke His special intervention is in place here. St.
Thomas always prayed before dictating or preach-
ing; he composed an admirable prayer for this use; 1
the child in knowledge, stammering in his effort at
expression, most naturally looks to find the word he
wants in the glance of God. But in knowledge it-
self, in Christian knowledge, we have the stepping-
stool which raises us a little towards God, so that we
return to study with soul enlightened and in a

sense with the gifts of the prophet.

Everything that instructs us leads to God on a
hidden byway. Every authentic truth is in itself
eternal, and its quality of eternity turns us towards
the eternity of which it is the revelation. Through
nature and the soul, where can we go if not towards

32
VIRTUES OF AN INTELLECTUAL

their origin? If one does not get there, it is because
one has gone off the path. At one bound the in-
spired and right mind goes beyond intermediaries,
and to every question that arises within it, what-
ever particular answers it may make, a secret voice
says: God!

Therefore, we have only to leave the mind on
the one hand to its upward flight, on the other to
its attention, and there will be set up, between the
object of a particular study and the object of re-
ligious contemplation, an alternating movement
which will profit both. With a rapid and often un-
conscious impulse, we pass from the trace or the
image to God, and then, coming back with new
vigor and strength, we retrace the footsteps of the
divine Walker. We now find things have a deeper
meaning, are magnified; we see in them an episode
of an immense spiritual happening. Even while we
busy ourselves with some trifling thing, we feel our-
selves dependent on truths in comparison with
which the mountains are ephemeral; infinite Being
and infinite duration enfold us, and our study is in
very truth, "a study of eternity."

IV

We have already said that the doctrine of the
composite nature of man forbids us to dissociate
spiritual functions from even those corporal func-
tions that are apparently least connected with pure
thought. St. Thomas subscribes to this ironical
notion of Aristotle: It is as ridiculous to say, the
33
soul alone understands, as to say, alone it builds or
weaves.! He himself advances the following proposi
tions which look materialistic: "The different dis
positions of men for the operations of the soul de.
pend on the different dispositions of their bodies"2
"To a good bodily constitution corresponds the
nobility of the soul."

That need not surprise us. Thought is born in
us after long processes of preparation in which the
whole bodily machine is at work. The chemistry of
the cell is the basis of everything; the most obscure
sensations prepare our experience; this experience
is the product of the work of the senses, which
slowly elaborate their acquisitions and fix them
through memory. It is amid physiological phe
nomena, in continuity with them and in depend-
ence on them, that the intellectual operation takes
place. No one thinks, even if he is only utilizing an
acquired idea, without calling up a whole complex
of images, emotions, sensations, which are the cul-

ture medium of the idea.

When we want to awaken a thought in anyone,
what are the means at our disposal? One only, to
produce in him by word and sign states of sensi-
bility and of imagination, emotion, and memory
in which he will discover our idea and make it his
own. Minds can only communicate through the
body. Similarly, the mind of each one of us can
with truth and with itself

only communicate

10.XIX de Veritate, art. 1, arg. 1.
2 De Memoria, lect. 1.
3 In II De Anima, lect. 19.
VIRTUES OF AN INTELLECTUAL

through the body. So much so, that the change by
which we pass from ignorance to knowledge must
be attributed, according to St. Thomas, directly to
the body and only accidentally to the intellectual

part of us.1

Should not this doctrine, continually recurring in
the Master's teaching, and so essentially, so provi-
dentially modern, engender the conviction that in
order to think, and especially in order to think
ardently and wisely throughout a lifetime, it is in-
dispensable to subject to the requirements of
thought not only the soul and its various faculties,
but also the body and the whole complex of its
organic functions? In an intellectual, everything
must be intellectual. The physical and mental com-
posite, the substance man, are at the service of that
special life which in some aspects seems hardly hu-
man: let them place no hindrances in the way! Let
us make ourselves a harmony of which the result

will be the conquest of the true.

Now, there are here two considerations that must
be faced without any human respect, although the
first customarily startles spiritual persons who lack

firmness of judgment.

First then, do not be ashamed to endeavor to

keep well.

Some mnen of genius have had miserably bad
health, and if it is God's will that that should hap-
pen to you, there is no more to be said. But if it is
your own fault, it is a very guilty instance of tempt-
ing God. Are you quite sure that, following the ex-

1 St. Thomas, Q.XXVI de Veritate art. 3, ad 12m.

35
THE INTELLE CTUAL LIFE

ample of men of genius, you will, like them, have
enough vigor to triumph in the incessant struggle
of the soul against the weakness of the flesh? There
is no proof that these great men themselves have not
had their talents turned astray or dimmed by their
physiological defects. Many intellectual anomalies
in the most gifted might perhaps be thus explained,
and so might the limited production of some
among them.

In men of otherwise equal gifts, it is certain that

sickness is a serious handicap. It lessens the output;
it interferes with the freedom of the soul at the
moment of its delicate operations; it sidetracks at
tention; it may warp the judgment by the effects
on imagination and the nervous reactions that suf
fering brings about. A disease of the stomach
changes a man's character, his character changes his
thoughts. If Leopardi had not been delicate and
deformed, would he have been among the pessi:

mists?

When, therefore, you resolve to live on a high
level, do not imagine that it is taking a low stand to
consider carefully, along with the activity of
thought itself, all the particulars of its organic sub-
structure. "A sound mind in a sound body" remains
the ideal. The thinker has a special physiology; he
must look after it and not hesitate to take expert

advice on the matter.1

In any case, ordinary current rules must be

obeyed. Sound hygiene is almost, for you, an intel-
lectual virtue. Among our moderns, whose philos-
ophy is sometimes so poor, the science of hygiene is
rich; do not despise it; it will enrich your philos-

ophy.

Live as much as possible in the open air. It is a

recognized fact that attention-the nerve of study-
is closcly related to breathing, and for general
health we know that plenty of oxygen is a first con-
dition. Windows open or partly open day and night
when prudence allows, frequent deep breathing ex-
ercises, combined with movements that amplify
them and make them nomal, walks before and
after work or even combined with work according
to the Greek tradition; all these practices are ex-

cellent.

It is important to work in a position that gives
free play to the lungs and does not compress the
other organs. It is good from time to time to inter-
rupt a spell of close application in order to breathe
deeply, to stretch one's limbs in two or three rhyth-
mic movements which relax the body and even
prevent it from getting wrinkles. It has been found
that slow and deep breaths, taken standing on tip-
toe, with the window open, are still more effective
as a relaxing agent. Neglect nothing where your

health is concerned.

Every day you should take exercise. Remember

the saying of an English doctor: "Those who do not
find tine to take exercise must find time to be ill."
If you cannot take exercise in the open air, there

are excellent substitute methods. That of I. P.
Muller is one of the most intelligent; and there
are others.

For a change some easy manual work is precious
both for mind and body. Our fathers knew that;
but our age is a mad age that mocks at nature, and
nature takes her revenge. Set aside every year, and
secondarily in the course of the year, time for real
vacations. By which I do not mean the entire ab-
sence of work-that would relax to excess faculties
already sufficiently inclined to instability-but the
predominance of rest, fresh air, and exercise outof-

doors.

Look after your diet. Light food, plain, moderate
in quantity and simply cooked, will enable you to
work more freely and alertly. A thinker does not

spend his life in the processes of digestion.

Pay still more attention to your sleep. Take
neither too much nor too little. Too much will
make you heavy, stupid, will slow up the blood
and the power of thinking; too little will expose
you to the risk of prolonging unduly the stimula-
tion of work and dangerously superimposing strain
upon strain. Watch yourself; in this question of
sleep, as in that of food, find out how much you
need and make a firm resolution to keep to it.

There is no general rule.

To sum up, you must understand that, for an
intellectual, care of the body, which is the instru-
ment of the soul, is virtue and wisdom; St. Thomas

explicitly attributes this character to it, and in-
cludes this wisdom for the body among the ele-
ments that contribute to temporal beatitude, the
first beginning of the other beatitude.! Do not turn
into a wizened and stunted creature, a failure, who
later on might be dull-witted, an old man before
his time, and therefore a foolish steward of the
talent entrusted to him by the Master.

But the care of our bodily partner includes other
elements also. We have spoken of the passions and
vices as formidable enemies of the mind. We were
thinking then of their psychological effects, of the
disturbance that they cause in the judgment, and
in the habitual tendency of the mind, which, when
they reach a certain degree, they turn into a power
of darkness. Now we are considering their physical
effects, which indirectly are again diseases of the

soul.

If one remains lazy, a glutton, a slave of the
pillow and of the table; if one abuses wine, alcohol,
tobacco; if one forgets oneself among unwhole-
some excitements, clinging to habits that are both
debilitating and nerve-exhausting, to sins that are
perhaps periodically forgiven, but of which the
effects remain, how can one practice the hygiene of

which we have urged the necessity?

A lover of pleasure is an enemy of his body and
therefore quickly becomes an enemy of his soul.
Mortification of the senses is necessary for thought,
and can alone bring us to that state of clear vision

of which Gratry spoke. If you obey the Hesh, you are on the way to become flesh, whereas you must become all spirit.

Why is St. Thomas called the Angelic Doctor


it only because of his winged genius? No, it is because everything in him was subordinated to his
brilliant and holy mind, because his flesh, native: :to
the coasts of the Tyrrhenian Sea, had taken on the

whiteness of Carmel and Hermon; because, being
chaste, temperate, quick to follow his soaring in-
spiration, and far from all excess, he was wholly a
soul, "an intelligence served by organs," according
to the famous definition.


I say to you, Catholic workers, and especially to
you young men, that discipline and mortification of
the body, along with the necessary care of it, of
which, in themselves, they form the better part,
are among the most precious safeguards of your
future.
