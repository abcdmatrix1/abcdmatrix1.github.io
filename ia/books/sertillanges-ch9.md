## I Keeping Contact with Life

After having made so many demands on the intellectual and apparently forged so many chains for him, will it seem like irony to turn to him once more and say: Keep your soul free. What matters most in life is not knowledge, but character; and character would be endangered if a man were under his work, so to speak, struggling with Sisyphus' stone. There is a knowledge other than that which is of the domain of memory: **the knowledge of how to live**. Study must be an act of life, must **serve life**, must feel itself impregnated with life. Of the two kinds of men, **those who endeavor to know something**, and those who try to be someone, the palm is to the second. What we know is like a beginning, a rough sketch only; the man is the finished work. 

It is certainly true that intellectuality contributes to the sovereignty of man; but it is not enough. Besides morality, which includes the life of religion, various broad aspects of the human condition must be considered. We have spoken of life in society, of practical activities: let us add communion with nature, care of one's home, the arts, friendly and formal gatherings, a little poetry, the practice of speaking, intelligent sport, public demonstrations.

It is hard to settle exactly the measure of all these things; I have confidence that the reader will find here at least the spirit in which to decide. It is a sure indication both for thought and practice to be able to appreciate the relative value of things.

Study is intended to bring about the extension of our being: it must not end by making us narrow. If art is man added to nature, knowledge is nature added to man: in both cases we must safeguard the man.

Pascal refuses his esteem to the specialist who is only a specialist; he does not want a man's book to be remembered the moment he comes into a room. "It is a bad mark," he says, and he does not mean it only from the point of view of comparative study which we have advocated; he is thinking of a harmonious human whole.

We must always be more than we are; the philosopher must be something of a poet, the poet something of a philosopher; the craftsman must be poet and philosopher on occasion, and the people recognize this fact. The writer must be a practical man, and the practical man must know how to write. Every specialist is first of all a person, and the essential quality of the person is beyond anything that he thinks or does.

Our destiny cannot be taken in as we take in some particular thing: we open out to it "with the lower of the mind" as Zoroaster says. Particular aims have not the value of life itself, nor acts that of action, nor talent that of a wide intuition in which the whole of existence finds a place; the work has not the value of the workman. Everything is harmful when severed fromn its broad connections, and only in our total setting does our soul reach its full expansion.

The man who thinks exclusively of his work, works badly: he cramps himself; he acquires a specialized bent which becomes a defect. The mind must stay open, must keep contact with humanity and with the world, so that every time it comes back to its work, it brings capacity for a new flight.

We have already quoted this saying of a rabbi: "Into a bushel full of nuts one can pour in addition many measures of oil"; we then applied it to studies which help one another instead of being in conflict. By the nuts let us now understand specialized work; one can add to it the oil of effortless intellectual life, leisure nobly employed, nature, art; all this does not overload the mind but, on the contrary, eases its strain.

The specialized work itself will be the gainer. It gains richly from society, friendships, external action: I have explained why. Here I am only expanding the conclusions we have reached, for they have a general bearing. Do you imagine that any specialized pursuit whatever is out of keeping with a visit to the Louvre, an evening spent listening to the Eroica Symphony or the Oedipus Rex, a walk about Versailles under the autumn trees, the sight of a sunset, a patriotic gathering in the great amphitheater of the Sorbonne, the Olympic Games, a Mystery play at Jumièges or in the theatre of Orange, a great sermon at Notre Dame?

It would be a very poor conception of thought not to see how it is connected with every manifestation of creative power.

Nature renews everything, refreshes every well-formed mind, opens up new vistas and suggests surveys that abstract thinking knows nothing of. The tree is a teacher; the field teems with ideas as with anemones or daisies; the clouds and stars in the revolving sky bring fresh inspiration; the mountains steady our thoughts with their mass; and the course of the running streams starts the mind on lofty meditations.

I know a man who at the sight of a rapid mountain torrent inevitably thought of the movement of worlds – those masses that rush through space with the same speed, under the governance of the same laws, depending on the same forces, thanks to the same God with whom everything begins and to whom everything returns. Going back to his work he felt himself uplifted by the unique Force, filled with the Presence that is everywhere; and his obscure activity was rooted in communion with all being.

Yet you let your mind get cramped and your heart grow dry, and you imagine that it is loss of time to follow the course of the torrents or to wander among the stars. The universe fills man with its glory, and you do not know it. The star of evening set against the darkening sky is lonely, it wants a place in your thought, and you refuse to admit it. You write, you compute, you string propositions together, you elaborate your theses, and you do not *look*.

Who does not know that in listening to music an intellectual may get an impression of greatness, beauty, power which is immediately transposed into his ordinary modes of thinking, furthers his purposes, colors his customary themes, and will presently enrich his working time? Does he not jot down rapidly on the back of his program the plan of a chapter or of a treatise, the idea of a development, or a vivid image? The harmony has heightened the tone of his inspiration, and the rhythm in which he is caught up like a passerby in a troop of soldiers on the march, has carried him away on new paths.

At Saint Sulpice, painting the Chapel of the Angels, Delacroix revelled in the sound of the great organ and in the chanting; to that harmony he attributed the extraordinary success of his Jacob wrestling, and of the rider in the *Heliodorus*.

Music has this precious quality for the intellectual that as it conveys no precise ideas, it interferes with none. It awakens states of soul, from which each one in his particular task will draw what he wills. Rodin makes a statue of it, Corot a landscape, Gratry a burning page, Pasteur a more inspired and attentive spell of research. Everything is contained in harmony, and everything is regenerated by it. Rhythm, the father of the world, is also the father of the intellect in which the world is reflected. On the indistinct horizon of his reverie, each one sees the vision of his choice and records its features in his own speech.

According to St. Thomas, the circumstances of our personality and surroundings form part of our activities; they concur in making of these an integral whole on which they stamp their characteristics. Shall the act of thinking be the only exception? Will our thought not be influenced by the setting — imaginative, sensorial, spiritual, social — that we succeed in providing, so that it may not now be an isolated song, but a voice in the orchestra?

One is a poor thing all by oneself in one's study! It is true one can bring the universe into it and people it with God; but that divine inhabitation is effective only after long experience, of which the elements are everywhere about us. Should I write under the impression of nature and of universal beauty, if great scenery, the peaceful countryside, the vision of the achievements of art, had not previously educated me?

We must widen our work in that way, in order not to be like the chained galley slave, or to turn intellectuality into an instrument of torture. Work is a free act.

You, therefore, who intend to devote yourself to the vocation of study, beware of turning your back for its sake on the rest of life. Give up nothing of what belongs to man. Preserve a balance in which the dominant weight does not try to carry all the rest with it. Learn to defend a thesis and to look at a sunrise, to bury yourself in profound abstractions and to play, like the Divine Master, with children. Nowadays the pedants' gowns and pointed caps that Pascal mocked at are not worn; but they still exist, they are hidden within, they are in the soul: do not array yourself in them. Refuse to be a brain detached from its body, and a human being who has cut out his soul. Do not make a monomania of work.

The intellectual I have in view is a man of wide and varied knowledge complementary to a special study thoroughly pursued; he loves the arts and natural beauty; his mind shows itself to be one in everyday occupations and in meditation: he is the same man in the presence of God, of his fellows, and of his maid, carrying within him a world of ideas and feelings that are not only written down in books and in discourses, but flow into his conversation with his friends, and guide his life.

At bottom, everything is connected and everything is the same thing. Intellectuality admits of no compartments. All the objects of our thought are so many doors into the "secret garden," the"wine cellar" which is the goal of ardent research. Thoughts and activities, realities and their reflections, all have one and the same Father. Philosophy, art, travel, domestic cares, finance, poetry, and tennis can be allied with one another, and conflict only through lack of harmony.

What is necessary every moment is to be where we ought to be and to do the thing that matters. Everything makes one harmony in the concert of the human and the divine.

## II. Knowing How to Relax

Everyone can see that to cultivate the kind of breadth we advocate is in itself to relax. The better part of relaxation is contained in the secondary modes of life that we have mentioned. It is a good thing however to speak more explicitly about rest, which is the pendant of work; through which therefore work is in a certain way defined, showing itself excessive, or reasonable, subject or not subject to the human rule which is confirmed by the law of God.

Nothing must be in excess. Work, precisely because it is a duty, requires limits which maintain it in full vigor, make it lasting, and enable it to yield in the course of life the greatest total effect of which it is capable.

Intemperance is a sin because it destroys us; and we have the obligation to use life wisely because we have the obligation to live. Now it is not only in coarse enjoyments that we can fall into intemperance; the subtlest and the noblest delights can partake of its harmful character. To love truth at the expense of prudence — that is, at the expense of the truth of life — is an absurdity. It proves that in spite of our protestations it is not truth that welove, but the pleasure we take in it, like those lovers of whom it is said that they like to love, and that they love love rather than its object.

Relaxation is a duty, like hygiene in which it is included, like the conservation of energy. "I pray thee, spare thyself at times," said St. Augustine to his disciple.[^921] The mind of itself does not grow
tíred, but the mind in the body grows tired; our powers of thought are proportioned to a certain element of action. Moreover, since the world of sense is our connatural setting, and since all the little practical actions form the web of the life we are adapted for, one cannot leave that lower sphere and rise up to the abstract without some fatigue. The effort cannot be continuous. We must come back to nature and plunge into it in order to recover our energy.[^922]

The man engaged in contemplation is "heavier than air": he can keep aloft only by a considerable expenditure of force: in a short time the supply of gas is exhausted and he must "flll up" again.

We can accept without paradox this saying of Bacon, which the discoveries of physiology corroborate: "To spend too much Time in Studies is Sloth." It is sloth directly, in as much as it is incapacity to overcome a fixed habit, to put on the brake sometimes. It is sloth indirectly because to refuse to rest is implicitly to refuse an effort that rest would render possible, and that overwork will make problematical. But it is sloth in a more hidden fashion also. In fact, physiologically, rest is tremendous work. When mental activity is interrupted, the inner nature of the body enters on a process of restoration which should be thorough. What we call leisure is but a transformation of energy.

In a theater, when the curtain falls, a whole army of workmen hurries on to the stage, cleaning, repairing, altering, and so preparing for the next act. If a stage manager were to interrupt or hinder this work, would he not be an enemy of the play, of the author, the interpreters, the public, himself? Similarly the man who overworks himself is going against his own vocation, against Him who has called him to it, against his brethren who would profit by what he does, against his own good.

The best way of all to relax would be, if possible, not to get tired; I mean, so to balance one's work that one operation would afford rest from another. In medicine, the effects of a harmful drug are often counteracted by its opposite. Not everything causes the same kind of fatigue, nor at the same moment. The puddler perspiring at his furnace would find it a rest to stack hay in the open country, and the man who stacks the hay to distribute it in the mangers.

We have already made some suggestions on this point. In speaking of the use of time, and then apropos of constancy in work, we touched on the principle of dividing up one's tasks. Not everything in intellectual work involves exhausting concentration; there are preliminaries, asides, practical corollaries of thought and creation. Choosing books, sorting papers, gathering up notes, classifying manuscripts, pasting insets in your margins, correcting proofs, tidying your study and your books; all these things keep you occupied but are not work. By good organization it is possible to work intensively only when one is deliberately ready to do so, and in the intervals to get through many of these not very tiring tasks, which yet are indispensable, and therefore have of themselves a certain value of contemplation.

This plan of arranging one's tasks according to the demands they make on the brain will have a double advantage: it will prevent overstrain, and will restore its pure value to intensive work. When one does not make room for rest, the rest one does not take takes itself: it steals into the work, under the form of distractions, of sleepiness, of necessary things that demand attention, not having been foreseen at the right time.

I am in the full swing of creative effort: I lack a reference; there is no ink in the bottle; I have forgotten to sort my notes; a book, a manuscript that I want are in another room, or buried under a pile from which they must be dug out. An hour ago all that would have been done easily, joyously, looking forward to the quiet hour that I was getting ready for. Now it disturbs me; my creative impulse dies. If I omitted these preparations because of some nominal work, some inferior occupation that I was bent on through lack of self-control, there is a double disaster; I arrive at this result: no real rest, no real work. Disorder reigns.

Avoid carefully, I said, in regard to the "moments of plenitude" the half-work which is half-rest and which is no good for anything. Work energetically, then relax, even if it is only that relative relaxation which prepares, subserves, or concludes the work.

Complete rest will, however, also be necessary, complete, I mean, through momentarily giving up every preoccupation with one's task —except that of the "permanent work" that we have seen to be so easy and so profitable.

St. Thomas explains that the true rest of the soul is joy, some activity in which we delight. Games, familiar conversation, friendship, family life, pleasant reading such as we have spoken of, communion with nature, some art accessible to us, some not tiring manual work, an intelligent stroll about town, theatrical performances that are not too exacting or too exciting, sport in moderation; these are our means of relaxation.

But they must not be carried to excess either. Protracted relaxation, besides eating up time, interferes with the momentum of a life of work. It is very important for each person to discover the harmonious alternation which leaves this momentum at its maximum with the minimum of fatigue. To work too long is to get worn-out; to stop too soon is to fail in giving one's measure. In the same way, to rest too long is to destroy the momentum acquired; to rest too little is to fail in renewing one's strength. Know yourself, and proportion things accordingly. With this reservation, frequent short spells of rest, which refresh without obliging you to make a complete new start afterwards, are the most advantageous.

Ah, if one could work in the heart of nature, one's window open on a fair landscape, so placed that when one was tired one could enjoy a few minutes in the green country; or, if one's thought was at a standstill ask a suggestion from the mountains, from the company of trees and clouds, from the passing animals, instead of painfully enduring one's dull mood-I am sure that the work produced would be doubled, and that it would be far more attractive, far more human.

One is such a realist in the country, and at the same time the soul moves on so high a plane! The categorical imperative was surely not conceived in a meadow, still less the so-called moral arithmetic of a Bentham.

To each young man who aspires to the heights and wants to go far, I say, keep within the reality of human nature. Secure yourself some leisure; do not exhaust yourself; work in tranquillity and in spiritual joy; be free. Use wiles with yourself if necessary; promise yourself in the moment of effort some pleasant relief of which the thought alone will refresh your mind until the moment comes when the actual pleasure will renew your energy. If you form a group, be considerate about one another's relaxations. St. Thomas says that the man who never jests, who does not take a joke and does not contribute to the amusements or recreations of others is a boor; he is a burden to his neighbor.[^923] One cannot live for a single day, said Aristotle, with an utterly gloomy man.

## III Accepting Our Trials

This balanced alternation of work and restful
joy is all the more necessary because the trials of
the worker are many. We have suggested this more
than once already. In knowledge, as in everything,
one attains salvation only through the crosS. Dis-
satisfaction with oneself, sluggishness of inspira-
tion, the indifference of those about one, envy, mis-
understandings, sarcastic remarks, acts of injustice,
the desertion of leaders, the falling-away of friends,
all these things can be part of the cross, and all of

them come in their turn.

"Superiority has to face so many obstacles and to
endure so much suffering," wrote George Sand
apropos of Balzac, "that the man who fulils the
mission of talent with patience and gentleness is a
great man." You will not take the last word to your-
self; but if in any degree you become someone, you
must expect rare trials and be prepared to taste to
the full their diferent qualities: the trial of the
ideal which appears further off the more eagerly
you strive to reach it; the trial of fools who do not
understand a word of what you say and take
scandal at it; the trial of jealous rivals who con-
sider you impudent because you have passed be-
yond their line of battle; the trial of the good who
