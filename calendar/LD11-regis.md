`1 Cor 15:20-26, 28`
> Brothers and sisters[^1]: Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen alseep. For since death came through man, the resurrection of the dead came also through man. For just as in Adam all die, so too in Christ shall all be brought to life, but each one in proper order: Christ the firstfruits; then, at his coming, those who belong to Christ; then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has destroyed every sovereignty and every authority and power.

## B
### Lectio I
`Dn 7:13-14`
As the visions during the night continued, I saw
    one like a Son of man coming,
        on the clouds of heaven;
    when he reached the Ancient One
        and was presented before him,
    the one like a Son of man received dominion, glory, and kingship;
        all peoples, nations, and languages serve him.
    His dominion is an everlasting dominion
        that shall not be taken away,
        his kingship shall not be destroyed.


### Salmo
`Ps 93:1, 1-2, 5`
**R. (1a) The Lord is king; he is robed in majesty.**
The LORD is king, in splendor robed;
    robed is the LORD and girt about with strength.

And he has made the world firm,
    not to be moved.
Your throne stands firm from of old;
    from everlasting you are, O LORD.

Your decrees are worthy of trust indeed;
    holiness befits your house,
    O LORD, for length of days.

### Lectio II
Rv 1:5-8
Jesus Christ is the faithful witness,
the firstborn of the dead and ruler of the kings of the earth. 
To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,
who has made us into a kingdom, priests for his God and Father,
to him be glory and power forever and ever.  Amen.
Behold, he is coming amid the clouds,
and every eye will see him,
even those who pierced him.
All the peoples of the earth will lament him.
Yes.  Amen.

"I am the Alpha and the Omega, " says the Lord God,
"the one who is and who was and who is to come, the almighty."


### Evangelio
`Jn 18:33b-37`
Pilate said to Jesus,
"Are you the King of the Jews?" 
Jesus answered, "Do you say this on your own
or have others told you about me?" 
Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I? 
Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. 
What have you done?" 
Jesus answered, "My kingdom does not belong to this world.
If my kingdom did belong to this world,
my attendants would be fighting
to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. 
But as it is, my kingdom is not here." 
So Pilate said to him, "Then you are a king?" 
Jesus answered, "You say I am a king. 
For this I was born and for this I came into the world,
to testify to the truth. 
Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice."

### lectio 1
`2 Sm 5:1-3`
> In those days, all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron and said:
"Here we are, your bone and your flesh.
In days past, when Saul was our king,
it was you who led the Israelites out and brought them back.
And the LORD said to you,
'You shall shepherd my people Israel
and shall be commander of Israel.'"
When all the elders of Israel came to David in Hebron,
King David made an agreement with them there before the LORD,
and they anointed him king of Israel.


> `ES` En aquellos días, todas las tribus de Israel fueron a Hebrón a ver a David, de la tribu de Judá, y le dijeron: "Somos de tu misma sangre. Ya desde antes, aunque Saúl reinaba sobre nosotros, tú eras el que conducía a Israel, pues ya el Señor te había dicho: 'Tú serás el pastor de Israel, mi pueblo; tú serás su guía' ".
> Así pues, los ancianos de Israel fueron a Hebrón a ver a David, rey de Judá. David hizo con ellos un pacto en presencia del Señor y ellos lo ungieron como rey de todas las tribus de Israel.


### salmo
`Ps 122:1-2, 3-4, 4-5`
`EN` **R. (cf. 1) Let us go rejoicing to the house of the Lord.**
I rejoiced because they said to me,
"We will go up to the house of the LORD."
And now we have set foot
within your gates, O Jerusalem.

Jerusalem, built as a city
with compact unity.
To it the tribes go up,
the tribes of the LORD.

According to the decree for Israel,
to give thanks to the name of the LORD.
In it are set up judgment seats,
seats for the house of David.

`ES` **R/. Vamos alegres a la casa del Señor**
Qué alegría cuando me dijeron:
«Vamos a la casa del Señor»!
Ya están pisando nuestros pies
tus umbrales, Jerusalén. R/.

Allá suben las tribus, las tribus del Señor,
según la costumbre de Israel,
a celebrar el nombre del Señor;
en ella están los tribunales de justicia,
en el palacio de David. R/.


### lectio 2
`Col 1:12-20`
> `EN` Brothers and sisters:
Let us give thanks to the Father,
who has made you fit to share[^2]
in the inheritance of the holy ones in light.
He delivered us from the power of darkness
and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,
in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
He is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn of all creation.
For in him were created all things in heaven and on earth,
the visible and the invisible,
whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers;
all things were created through him and for him.
He is before all things,
and in him all things hold together.
He is the head of the body, the church.
He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
that in all things he himself might be preeminent.
For in him all the fullness was pleased to dwell,
and through him to reconcile all things for him,
making peace by the blood of his cross
through him, whether those on earth or those in heaven.

> `ES` Hermanos:
Demos gracias a Dios Padre, que os ha hecho capaces de compartir la herencia del pueblo santo en la luz.
Él nos ha sacado del dominio de las tinieblas,
y nos ha trasladado
al reino del Hijo de su amor,
por cuya sangre hemos recibido la redención,
el perdón de los pecados.
Él es imagen del Dios invisible,
primogénito de toda criatura;
porque en él fueron creadas todas las cosas:
celestes y terrestres,
visibles e invisibles.
Tronos y Dominaciones,
Principados y Potestades;
todo fue creado por él y para él.
Él es anterior a todo,
y todo se mantiene en él.
Él es también la cabeza del cuerpo: de la Iglesia.
Él es el principio, el primogénito de entre los muertos, y así es el primero en todo.
Porque en él quiso Dios que residiera toda la plenitud. Y por él y para él
quiso reconciliar todas las cosas,
las del cielo y las de la tierra,
haciendo la paz por la sangre de su cruz.


### evangelio
`Lk 23:35-43`
> `EN` The rulers sneered at Jesus and said,
"He saved others, let him save himself
if he is the chosen one, the Christ of God."
Even the soldiers jeered at him.
As they approached to offer him wine they called out,
"If you are King of the Jews, save yourself."
Above him there was an inscription that read,
"This is the King of the Jews."
Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying,
"Are you not the Christ?
Save yourself and us."
The other, however, rebuking him, said in reply,
"Have you no fear of God,
for you are subject to the same condemnation?
And indeed, we have been condemned justly,
for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes,
but this man has done nothing criminal."
Then he said,
"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
He replied to him,
"Amen, I say to you,
today you will be with me in Paradise."



> `ES` En aquel tiempo, los magistrados hacían muecas a Jesús diciendo:
«A otros ha salvado; que se salve a sí mismo, si él es el Mesías de Dios, el Elegido».
Se burlaban de él también los soldados, que se acercaban y le ofrecían vinagre, diciendo:
«Si eres tú el rey de los judíos, sálvate a ti mismo».
Había también por encima de él un letrero:
«Este es el rey de los judíos».
Uno de los malhechores crucificados lo insultaba diciendo:
«¿No eres tú el Mesías? Sálvate a ti mismo y a nosotros».
Pero el otro, respondiéndole e increpándolo, le decía:
«¿Ni siquiera temes tú a Dios, estando en la misma condena? Nosotros, en verdad, lo estamos justamente, porque recibimos el justo pago de lo que hicimos; en cambio, este no ha hecho nada malo».
Y decía:
«Jesús, acuérdate de mí cuando llegues a tu reino».
Jesús le dijo:
«En verdad te digo: hoy estarás conmigo en el paraíso».
