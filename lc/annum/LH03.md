`KR` 히브 10,32-39
형제 여러분, 32 예전에 여러분이 빛을 받은 뒤에
많은 고난의 싸움을 견디어 낸 때를 기억해 보십시오.
33 어떤 때에는 공공연히 모욕과 환난을 당하기도 하고,
어떤 때에는 그러한 처지에 빠진 이들에게 동무가 되어 주기도 하였습니다.
34 여러분은 또한 감옥에 갇힌 이들과 고통을 함께 나누었고,
재산을 빼앗기는 일도 기쁘게 받아들였습니다.
그보다 더 좋고 또 길이 남는 재산을 가지고 있다는 것을 알고 있었기 때문입니다.
35 그러니 여러분의 그 확신을 버리지 마십시오.
그것은 큰 상을 가져다줍니다.
36 여러분이 하느님의 뜻을 이루어 약속된 것을 얻으려면 인내가 필요합니다.
37 “조금만 더 있으면 올 이가 오리라. 지체하지 않으리라.
38 나의 의인은 믿음으로 살리라.
그러나 뒤로 물러서는 자는 내 마음이 기꺼워하지 않는다.”
39 우리는 뒤로 물러나 멸망할 사람이 아니라,
믿어서 생명을 얻을 사람입니다.


`EN NRSV` 32 But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, 
33 sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. 
34 For you had compassion for those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one. 
35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. 
36 For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. 
37 For yet “in a very little while, the one who is coming will come and will not delay; 
38 but my righteous one will live by faith. My soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back.” 
39 But we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost, but among those who have faith and so are saved.

Responsorial Psalm: Psalms 37:3-4, 5-6, 27-28, 39-40
3 Trust in the Lord, and do good; so you will live in the land, and enjoy security. 
4 Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart. 
5 Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him, and he will act. 
6 He will make your vindication shine like the light, and the justice of your cause like the noonday. 
27 Turn away from evil, and do good; so you shall abide forever. 
28 For the Lord loves justice; he will not forsake his faithful ones. The unjust shall be destroyed for ever, the offspring of the wicked shall be cut off. 
39 The salvation of the righteous is from the Lord; he is their refuge in time of trouble. 
40 The Lord helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked, and saves them, because they take refuge in him.

Gospel: Mark 4:26-34
26 He also said, “The kingdom of God is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground, 
27 and would sleep and rise night and day, and the seed would sprout and grow, he does not know how. 
28 The earth produces of itself, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head. 
29 But when the grain is ripe, at once he goes in with his sickle, because the harvest has come.” 
30 He also said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable will we use for it? 
31 It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; 
32 yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.” 
33 With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it; 
34 he did not speak to them except in parables, but he explained everything in private to his disciples.
